SQL Practice Problems

Basic SQL: Manipulate Data
Query table: scratch.sql_practice
Hint: these problems may require using Order By, Arithmetic, and Where statements that leverage AND/OR

Example Problem:
1. What is the average partisanship score for 18-34 white voters in WI?
Answer: 0.538
Query:
select 
avg_part_score,
*
from scratch.sql_practice
where vf_source_state = 'WI' and race = 'White' and age_bucket = '18-34'
;

Practice Problems:
   2. What are the average partisanship scores by age for all white voters in WI? Your query will return a table of data�order the rows by age to sort it youngest to oldest
avg_part_score        age_bucket        vf_source_state        race
0.538101145662515        18-34        WI        White
0.516410841571253        35-49        WI        White
0.46268441934293        50-64        WI        White
0.488928073112574        65+        WI        White
Query:
select 
avg_part_score,
age_bucket,
vf_source_state,
race
FROM scratch.sql_practice
where (vf_source_state = 'WI' and race = 'White')
order by age_bucket

   3. How many Hispanic people are college educated in AZ?
Sum = 93778
SELECT SUM (pop_college)
FROM scratch.sql_practice
where race = 'Hispanic' and vf_source_state='AZ'
;
   4. How many voters 18-34 are college educated in NH?
Sum = 7600 
select sum (pop_college)
from scratch.sql_practice
where age_bucket = '18-34' and vf_source_state = 'NH'
;
   5. Among Black voters in MI and WI, what age bucket has the highest turnout score?
Highest Age Turnout score : 50-64
select avg_turnout_score,
*
from scratch.sql_practice 
where (vf_source_state = 'MI' and race='AfAm') or (vf_source_state = 'WI' and race ='AfAm')
order by avg_turnout_score desc
   6. How many college-educated people in NV are aged 18-34 or Hispanic?
A: 42192
select sum (pop_college)
from scratch.sql_practice
where (vf_source_state = 'NV') and (age_bucket = '18-34'or race = 'Hispanic')

   7. How many women in PA are 35-49 or Asian in PA? (Hint: This query will require using the AND function together with the OR function, and then adding up the resulting rows)
A: 1293359
select sum (pop_female)
from scratch.sql_practice
where (race = 'Asian' or age_bucket = '35-49')
and vf_source_state = 'PA'

   8. Create a column that calculates the sum of women and parents
select pop_college + pop_parent AS pop_collpar
from scratch.sql_practice
